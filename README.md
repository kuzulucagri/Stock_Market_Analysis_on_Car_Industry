"The Role of Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model in Predicting Stock Market" ðŸ§  

ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Analysis is an application that helps predict the potential changes and risks of the market value from time to time. It is the process of evaluating and measuring the decision to sell or buy company stock.

âœ… In this project, I prepared statistics and time series analyzes by taking the stock market data of 3 automotive companies (BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen). I also examined the correlations between the stocks and their investment risk values. I made predictions with LSTM, a deep learning model. 

For sure later, new machine learning models can be added to compare prediction metrics, or the prediction metrics of the model can be improved with optimization algorithms.
